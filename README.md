p1: Neuroscience Predictive Model for Mental Health Outcomes
Project Summary:
A Python simulation engine to model “belif” dynamics in a person over time. It calculates how daily stress, recovery, and belief in cycles affect emotional stability and longevity.
Features:
Simulates daily meaning drain and refill
Supports both single runs and batch runs to analyze trends
Parameter sweep for testing different leak and recovery values
Tracks survival rates and statistical outcomes (mean, std deviation)
Saves history of previous runs for comparison.

p2 Module1:
      Core Functionality:
Geolocation via IP (ipapi.co)
Satellite tracking API integration (n2yo.com)
3D distance calculations using haversine, and Pythagorean theorem
Real time closest satellite identification.
